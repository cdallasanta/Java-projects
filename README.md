# Java-projects
This is a series of projects found on this link or through "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart in order to practice my python scripting.

Here are the porjects in this repository so far:

Bottles.java - 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall Lyrics
-Learning ifs and System.out.println


#(not yet in repository)
magic ball.py - Magic 8 Ball. Type in a question, it will give an answer
-Answers are in a list that are easy to add to
-Will add a GUI once I learn about those modules

collatz.py - Input a number and it uses the Collatz Conjecture until the number reaches 1
-Practicing for loops, defining functions, and handling errors

(not yet on github) Pythagorean Triples Checker - Type in 3 sides of a triangle and it will return if it is a right triangle or not.
-Practicing using different input values

coin estimator.py - Coin Estimator By Weight - based on the weight of your coin collection, how many wrappers do you need and the total value
-This is very much a work in progress. It started as a ton of dictionaries before trying to convert them into a cleaner pandas dataframe. Then I learned that I'm not as familiar with dataframes as I thought.
