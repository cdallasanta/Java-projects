# Java-projects
This is a series of projects found on [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TyqD2_oDtiQIh_Y55J5RfeA91JJECc97xYIKM112H9I/edit") or through "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart in order to practice my java scripting.

Here are the porjects in this repository so far:

Bottles.java - 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall Lyrics
-Learning ifs and System.out.println

Magic8Ball.java - Magic 8 Ball. Type in a question, it will give an answer
-Answers are in a list that are easy to add to
-uses random numbers, lists, and a somewhat arbitrary scanner object
-Will add a GUI once I learn about those modules


#(not yet in repository, copied from the python folder where I'm working on the same projects)
collatz.py - Input a number and it uses the Collatz Conjecture until the number reaches 1
-Practicing for loops, defining functions, and handling errors

(not yet on github) Pythagorean Triples Checker - Type in 3 sides of a triangle and it will return if it is a right triangle or not.
-Practicing using different input values

coin estimator.py - Coin Estimator By Weight - based on the weight of your coin collection, how many wrappers do you need and the total value
-This is very much a work in progress. It started as a ton of dictionaries before trying to convert them into a cleaner pandas dataframe. Then I learned that I'm not as familiar with dataframes as I thought.
